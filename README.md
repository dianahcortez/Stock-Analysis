## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze what refactoring existing Microsoft Excel VBA code to determine if it would speed up the processing time.  The existing code analyzed a sample of stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 to determine for the client if the stocks were worth investing in.  Specifically analyzing the total daily volume of each stock and what the overall rate of return was in a (+/-)  (%) format.

### Analysis Results 
Project began with utilizing the Excel VBA code that was provided to create each input box, chart headers, as well as the stock ticker array, and lastly to activate the required worksheet “AllStocksAnalysis”.

### Summary
As stated by bmc.com, refactoring code is the process of restricting computer code without changing or adding to its external behavior and functionality.  Stating more simply, its turning dirty or “bulky” code into a cleaner and more efficient format.

### The Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
As stated previously, refactoring code helps us clean it up and make it more organized.  Advantages of doing this refactoring process is to speed up the software, assist with debugging and makes for a more organized and faster programming.  Another advantage is a refactored code is much easier to read, because it is concise and forthright.  Some disadvantages of refactoring could be when one has a very large application, which could lead to new bugs and/or errors in the code.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges I faced with this project was identifying and defining the arrays as it was a very new concept to me.  VBA is extremely finicky with even the smallest mistake breaking a whole ‘If Then code.  I struggled with making sure the code was properly formatted/clean, and was able to find all my typo’s by looking at the code line by line to see where the breaks were.
